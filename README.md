# Pizza Ordering Chatbot with Sentiment Analysis and Voice Confirmation

This repository contains the code for a **Pizza Ordering Chatbot** built using **Amazon Lex**, **AWS Lambda**, **Amazon Comprehend**, and **Amazon Polly**. The chatbot assists users in placing pizza orders by guiding them through selecting their desired pizza type, size, crust, toppings, and other details. The chatbot also utilizes **Amazon Comprehend** to analyze the sentiment of user input, adapting its tone for a more empathetic experience. Additionally, **Amazon Polly** is integrated to provide voice-confirmed order summaries.

## Project Overview

The **Pizza Ordering Chatbot** enables users to interact with a virtual assistant for ordering pizza. Through guided prompts, it collects necessary details from users, such as pizza type, size, crust, toppings, and contact information. The chatbot confirms orders when all required details are provided and offers a personalized touch by analyzing the sentiment of user input and adjusting responses accordingly. Now, with **Amazon Polly**, users receive their order confirmation as an audio message, enhancing accessibility and engagement.

### Key Features

- **Pizza Order Collection**: Gathers essential details from the user, including pizza type, size, crust, toppings, and contact information.
- **Slot Elicitation**: Uses Amazon Lex's dialog management to prompt users for missing details.
- **Order Confirmation**: Confirms the order details once all required slots are filled and provides a friendly summary.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Adjusts responses based on user sentiment detected through Amazon Comprehend.
  - **Positive sentiment**: Friendly and enthusiastic responses.
  - **Negative sentiment**: Empathetic and supportive tone to address possible user frustration or mood.
- **Voice Confirmation**: Utilizes Amazon Polly to generate an audio message summarizing the user’s order details, which is then uploaded to Amazon S3 and provided as a clickable link for the user.

## Services and Technologies Used

This project leverages multiple AWS services to create an efficient, user-friendly experience:

1. **Amazon Lex**: Provides the conversational interface, processing user inputs and managing conversation flow.
2. **AWS Lambda**: Runs the backend logic, handling user input processing, collecting order details, and calling Amazon Comprehend and Amazon Polly as needed.
3. **Amazon Comprehend**: Analyzes the sentiment of the user’s input, allowing the chatbot to tailor responses based on emotional tone.
4. **Amazon Polly**: Converts text-based order confirmations into audio files for a more accessible and engaging user experience.
5. **Amazon S3**: Stores audio files generated by Amazon Polly and provides secure, accessible links to these audio files for users.

## Advantages of This Approach

1. **Enhanced User Experience**:
   - Sentiment analysis allows the chatbot to respond appropriately to the user's mood, enhancing the interaction by making it feel more human and empathetic.
   - Voice-based confirmation with Amazon Polly makes the service accessible and engaging, catering to users who prefer audio feedback.

2. **Automated Pizza Ordering**:
   - The chatbot ensures all required order information is collected and confirmed with the user, minimizing order errors and providing a smooth ordering experience.

3. **Scalability and Cost-Efficiency**:
   - AWS services like Lambda, Lex, and Polly allow for automatic scaling to handle high volumes of user interactions.
   - The serverless infrastructure and pay-as-you-go pricing make the system cost-effective for small to medium-sized businesses.

4. **Adaptability**:
   - Easily adaptable for other use cases, such as booking or customer service, and can be integrated with additional systems, like payment gateways or order management systems.
   - Sentiment analysis and voice confirmation features enhance versatility, enabling personalized experiences across different industries.

5. **Multi-Channel Accessibility**:
   - Audio confirmations from Amazon Polly make the chatbot suitable for users with accessibility needs, ensuring a wider range of users can benefit from the service.

## Workflow

1. **User Input**: The user begins a conversation with the chatbot, specifying their pizza order preferences.
2. **Slot Filling**: The chatbot collects all necessary details (pizza type, size, crust, toppings, etc.). If any details are missing, it prompts the user.
3. **Sentiment Analysis**: During the conversation, the sentiment of user input is analyzed to detect positive, neutral, or negative emotions. Responses are adapted accordingly to enhance user experience.
4. **Order Confirmation and Audio Generation**:
   - Once all required details are gathered, the chatbot confirms the order, summarizing the user's choices in a friendly response.
   - Amazon Polly generates an audio confirmation of the order summary. This audio file is then uploaded to Amazon S3, and a secure link is shared with the user for playback.
5. **End Conversation**: After confirming the order and providing the audio link, the chatbot ends the conversation.

## Future Enhancements

- **Full Voice Interaction**: Extend Amazon Polly to enable full voice interaction, allowing users to converse with the chatbot hands-free.
- **Multilingual Support**: Provide language-specific sentiment analysis and audio confirmations, enabling the chatbot to serve a wider, multilingual audience.
- **Integration with Order History**: Allow returning customers to quickly reorder past orders by retrieving and displaying previous selections.
- **Recommendations Based on User Preferences**: Introduce machine learning to recommend pizzas based on user preferences or past orders, enhancing the ordering experience.
- **Enhanced Sentiment Categories**: Use Amazon Comprehend to detect a broader range of emotions, like excitement or disappointment, for even more tailored responses.

## Conclusion
